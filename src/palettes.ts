// Eight palettes after colours documented in eighteenth-century France: court fashion names, Sèvres
// porcelain grounds, toile de Jouy dyes, chalk drawings and the materials of revolutionary Paris. Each has a
// light reading, by daylight on a pale page, and a dark one, by candlelight on a dark page. Their washes
// stand 6:1 to 10:1 in contrast from their paper, around the default bistre's 8.4:1, and their inks at least 7:1.
